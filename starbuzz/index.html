	<h2>House Blend, $1.49</h2>
	<p>It’s deceptively simple. A blend of fine Latin American beans
		roasted to a glistening, dark chestnut color. Loaded with flavor,
		balancing tastes of nut and cocoa, just a touch of sweetness from the
		roast. This coffee is our beginning, the very first blend we ever
		created for you back in 1971. And this one blend set the course for
		the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true
		reflection of us and a delicious cup of coffee, period. It all starts
		from here.</p>

	<h2>Mocha Cafe Latte, $2.35</h2>
	<p>A caffè mocha (/ˈmɒkə/ or /ˈmoʊkə/), also called mocaccino
		(Italian: [mokatˈtʃiːno]), is a chocolate-flavored variant of a caffè
		latte. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino and also
		mochachino. The name is derived from the city of Mocha, Yemen, which
		was one of the centers of early coffee trade.</p>

	<h2>Cappuccino, $1.89</h2>
	<p>A cappuccino (/ˌkæpʊˈtʃiːnoʊ/ (About this sound listen); Italian
		pronunciation: [kapputˈtʃiːno] Italian plural cappuccini) is an
		espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is
		traditionally prepared with double espresso, and steamed milk foam.

		Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, and
		flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder. It is typically
		smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of micro
		foam. The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour
		of their habits, and in this context referring to the colour of the
		beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee
		(today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern
		cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long
		evolution of the drink. The Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner"
		possibly in the 18th century on a version that included whipped cream
		and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown
		outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of
		Viennese-style cafés in Trieste and other cities in the former Austria
		in the first decades of the 20th century. The drink has since spread
		worldwide and can be found at a number of establishments.</p>
